                    <h3>Betelihium Lewis</h3>My best friend and I have been long distance for over 10 years. She lives in Chilliwack so I try to surprise her with something nice each year for her birthday. “ Floral Beauty ” has always made the process so seamless online, and never fails to go above and beyond with my expectations. Thank you!!! Your efforts make a huge difference.
                
            
            
                
                    <h3>Himanshi Khurana</h3>Ordering online on your website was easy and there was a good array of flower arrangements to choose from. The delivery arrived at the time requested. Overall, it was a positive buying experience.

                
            
            
                
                    <h3>Inder Chahal</h3>Yellow being a favourite colour, the variety of different flowers coloured yellow was impressive. As the vase was very nice, I was wondering if prices could be diminished if vases from past deliveries could be a financial asset for orders to follow.

                
            
            
                
                    <h3>Sidhu Moosewala</h3>The flowers were beautiful! I ordered flowers to be delivered to a business as the Gramma of the family business passed away. I wanted bright and cheery. The ordering online was so easy and the delivery was so fast!!! It was great. Although the flower arrangement did not look too much like what I ordered I realize maybe it’s the time of year and they were still so beautiful. Will order again from here!

                
            
            
                
                    <h3>Salman Khan</h3>The floral arrangements I have seen and ordered through the Floral Beauty have been the prettiest I have ever seen. The attention to detail on delivery request is amazing. I will be ordering all my flowers from the Floral Beauty and have referred many others. Great experience with a 5 out of 5. Thank you
